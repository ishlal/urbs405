# URBS405 Final Project

URBS405: Religion, Social Justice & Urban Development is a course taught at the University of Pennsylvania by Professor Andrew T. Lamas
This project is a website developed by me which features a collection of notes from the students of this class. We wanted to commemorate our experience and lessons learned, and this website is an attempt to do such justice.
