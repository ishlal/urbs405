      &quot I agree that this is a great reflection. On the point of using your computer vs the notebook, 
      I found myself with similar hesitancies. Especially when doing readings, I found it much easier to copy and paste interesting sections 
      from the readings onto an online note. However, what led me to settle for using a notebook for the entire class is how it forces you 
      to be more sentient about the information you consume, and conscious of every word you read and write.  Yes the whole process is more 
      time consuming, but I feel that the exercise of writing in a notebook has made me more critical of the ideas presented in the readings 
      and class &quot ~Nathan Chen">

      &quot what an excellent piece of writing recounting a memory that still stays vividly in my mind. 
      The hesitancy regarding journaling (in the prior picture) is one that I quite resonate with and empathize with 
      the inability to accurately articulate thoughts. I think this is where other forms of art (like the drawing you have provided) 
      substitute well in, because the drawing conveys much more than words could. The poem too -- amazing. Thank you so much for sharing sharing this!  &quot ~Ishaan Lal">

      &quot The dichotomy of being &quot at Penn &quot versus &quot of Penn &quot is central in my life as someone who grew up just 
      a mile away from the university. As a student here I sometimes feel like I am walking the line between blending 
      in with other Penn students and staying within the comfortable campus bubble most days but then also going to my 
      childhood home off campus and spending time in my community as a community member and not a Penn student. I strive to 
      be intentional in not being &quot of Penn, &quot working to give back to my community not just through temporary service initiatives 
      but a meaningful commitment to a lifetime of service.  &quot ~Faith Applegate

      &quot This is something I've thought a lot about too and I think what brings us to hermeneutics and understanding the layers 
      of interpretation - I think there's been a lot of recent emphasis on self-awareness when it comes to bias and how that impacts 
      personal interpretation, but how far back do you have to go to get to pure, original thought? Narrow worldviews from all kinds of 
      backgrounds have been dictating how we read and understand text for centuries, so it takes a lot more than a reflection on individual 
      biases to get to the root of what was originally intended by the writing (our conversation with Hal helped develop these ideas, as well).

      &quot  I'd tend to agree with you. Another notion of an idea being &quot sacred &quot also has to do with popularity of an idea. 
      That is, a popular sacred belief would be much more difficult to change than an unpopular sacred belief. It comes to me, 
      how do we analyze sacred beliefs from a popularity standpoint? Does a sacred belief that is popular make it any more or less sacred? 
      I would think no. I like the point of how changing some sacred beliefs from religion would fundamentally change the religion altogether. 
      It would be interesting to fully investigate the intersection of sacred beliefs between all religions.  &quot ~Ishaan Lal">

      &quot  Your observations around the political context of sympathy vs morality are very interesting.

      &quot  I love this because we usually see beauty (of women, specifically) talked about as a very surface-level quality 
      that's almost undeserving of much &quot unpacking &quot or complex thought, so seeing that perspective of shallowness 
      contrasted with &quot self-reclamation &quot through Sarah's work created a really strong foundation for 
      speaking about beauty as more than just superficial appearances. &quot ~Sophia Leung">

      &quot I have similar questions about New Zealand, where recent political and social events have made the future far 
      less certain than it once was. With political fluctuations and rising crime, people are increasingly worried about the 
      what the future entails. However, think we were able to see a glimpse into an avenue of change recently when Posie Parker, 
      a right-wing anti-trans right activist, came to our shores. She had tomato sauce thrown at her, was heckled wherever she went, 
      and was ultimately booed out of the country. Whilst this might be viewed as a toy example, power ultimately, does lay in the hands 
      of the people, and with enough provocation and dissatisfaction, citizens coming together have the power to shape the values and actions 
      of a country. &quot ~Nathan Chen

      &quot Great point, although I would pose the question, is there anything better than philanthropy in a capitalist system to uplift the most 
      vulnerable amongst us? We can strive for a more equitable economic system and strive for greater equality, but in a system which is built 
      upon hierarchies and individual success, how else can wealthy individuals help the less fortunate without sacrificing their own success?

      <h4>URBS 4050, Spring 2023</h4>
      <p> On a dark evening in late January, a group of students gathered together on the third floor of McNeil Building at
        the University of Pennsylvania. Professor Andrew Lamas walked through the doors, and his first words spoken to the class 
      were: "this is not going to work". It was then that began the transcendence of us students' ability to understand the world, 
      as we spent the next hours discussing the implicit hierarchy found in a classroom's layout where tables are aligned in rows instead of a circle.
      The rest of the semester was filled with similar relevant discussions: from understanding the interpretation of religion throughout the centuries,
      to learning the different ways of perceiving art, to learning about local currencies, to discussing whom the Earth belongs to.
    
      
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our class consisted of 13 diverse students and 1 wise, amazing professor. Us students represented all four schools at UPenn: Arts & Sciences, Engineering,
      Wharton, and Nursing. The diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and thoughts allowed us all to broaden our minds. It is without doubt that 
      the conversations had and lessons learned throughout the semester are things that will stick with us throughout life. 
    
      </p>
      <p>

        We dedicate this project to Professor Lamas. Early in the semester, Professor Lamas provided us students with small journals and encouraged us
      to write down any thoughts we had throughout the semester. This website is a cultivation of a subset of our work -- a conglomeration of 
      some of the most meaningful ideas, thoughts, and images we had.
